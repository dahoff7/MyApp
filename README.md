# MyApp
RCV App for EGEN310

# Set up
- Pull this code onto your laptop and your Arduino Nano 33 BLE
- On your Arduino Nano: Upload file and you should see the LED on board go from blinking to solid on

- On your laptop: connect your phone to Android Studio and enable it to run on it
- Open the app on your phone, use the BLE scanner to connect to your arduino, and you are good to go!

# Notes about the files
- In the java/com.example.ardroid file, as well as in res/layout, and res/menu, all contain files that I wrote. All the files in those
folders part written by me and part generated by AndroidStudio, which is what I wrote this app one, when you add buttons, and move things
around.
